<h1>Short Horror Story</h1>
<p>I could hear a voice calling my name, a voice I haven't heard in years but it felt so famillar The Wind blew hard and The Snow kept coming down it was like a never ending winter it just never seemed to stop. The Voice came from the forest it sounded human but it's voice felt off and unsettling I could hear foot step's running into My direction, My eyes shaked nervously as lucy my dog barked staring into the forest I could barely see anything all I could do was listen my hand's wrapped around the dog's leash trying to calm her down something awful must lerk in the forest because that was the last time ive seen lucy all I could find was her collar ripped in half on a pile of red snow. </p>

<h1> Second Short Horror Story</h1>
<p>Thy screams of the children who have been wrong echoed through out the building waiting to get their revenge your dreams filled with nightmares, The cuts you wake up with on your body is only the way to say they wanna have some fun as they dim the curtain and lock the doors all the exits are no more.


Shadows run through the holes, as spirits tangle from the roof's staring their murders in the eyes the screams of your loved one's fill the air as you watch their corpses get eaten one by one because of how much the kids are hungry with rage.. </p>
