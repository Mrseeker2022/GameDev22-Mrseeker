<h1>Short Horror Story</h1>
<p>I could hear a voice calling my name, a voice I haven't heard in years but it felt so famillar The Wind blew hard and The Snow kept coming down it was like a never ending winter it just never seemed to stop. The Voice came from the forest it sounded human but it's voice felt off and unsettling I could hear foot step's running into My direction, My eyes shaked nervously as lucy my dog barked staring into the forest I could barely see anything all I could do was listen my hand's wrapped around the dog's leash trying to calm her down something awful must lerk in the forest because that was the last time ive seen lucy all I could find was her collar ripped in half on a pile of red snow. </p>

<h1> Second Short Horror Story</h1>
<p>Thy screams of the children who have been wrong echoed through out the building waiting to get their revenge your dreams filled with nightmares, The cuts you wake up with on your body is only the way to say they wanna have some fun as they dim the curtain and lock the doors all the exits are no more.


Shadows run through the holes, as spirits tangle from the roof's staring their murders in the eyes the screams of your loved one's fill the air as you watch their corpses get eaten one by one because of how much the kids are hungry with rage.. </p>

<h1> Third Short Horror Story</h1>
<p>The Blood that stain's the wall's don't exist, The creature stare's into your soul and never looks away it neither blink's nor breathe as this is your last day on earth taken to a gateway that is neither hell nor purgatory but much worse the clock alway's ticks sideway's doctor phil stands in the corner the last face you'll see and the only word's speaked from the him is "no matter how flat you make a pancake, it's got two sides." The darkness of the room surrounds you. a wheel chair rolls on it's wheel you could hear it roll and squeak a rises from it the man on the ground sings you a song. 
  The man die's and a demonic voice come's from his throat "HM Patato." it is silence once more. The ground shakes horribly as you rip off your shoe's like this but you have no control of yourself, You have no idea what todo your shoe's made a weird noise while breaking a voice imerges from you
